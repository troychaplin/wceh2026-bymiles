# WordCamp Canada 2026 Theme

This WordPress block theme was generated by [Miles AI](https://bymiles.ai/) during a beta test of the Miles platform. The goal of this project is to explore whether Miles can power the design and development of the official 2026 WordCamp Canada website.

> **Beta Notice:** This theme was produced as part of an early access evaluation of Miles AI's theme generation capabilities. It represents a snapshot of what the platform can produce and is intended as a starting point for further refinement, not a final production deliverable.

## About the Theme

- **Theme Name:** WordCamp Canada 2026
- **Author:** [Miles AI](https://bymiles.ai/)
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **License:** GPL v2 or later
- **WordPress:** Requires 6.0+, tested up to 6.7
- **PHP:** Requires 7.4+

This is a full block theme built entirely around the WordPress Site Editor. It uses `theme.json` (schema v3) for configuration, HTML-based block templates, and 50 reusable block patterns. There are no classic PHP templates — everything is editable through the block editor.

## Design System

The theme uses a dark color palette with a teal accent, designed around the WordCamp Canada brand:

| Token              | Value                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Background          | `#0D1420`                    |
| Text                | `#F2EDE8`                    |
| Accent              | `#3BE8A0`                    |
| Display Font        | Bricolage Grotesque          |
| Body Font           | Source Sans 3                |
| Content Width       | 1200px                       |
| Wide Width          | 1400px                       |

Typography uses fluid sizing for headings, scaling responsively across breakpoints.

## Block Patterns

The theme ships with 50 block patterns organized across these categories:

- **Hero sections** — Full-screen heroes with background images, CTAs, and stat counters
- **Content grids** — Speaker grids, blog archives, article cards, portfolio layouts
- **Event sections** — Schedule timelines, venue details, ticket/pricing cards, sponsor tiers
- **About/Feature sections** — Conference pillars, stat counters with animations, about layouts
- **Testimonials** — Author testimonials and review cards
- **Newsletter/CTA** — Email signup forms with animated backgrounds
- **Footers** — Themed footer layouts including an animated underwater variant
- **Single templates** — Post, page, and project detail patterns

## JavaScript Features

The `script.js` file provides lightweight, vanilla JS functionality:

- **Header scroll effect** — Adds an `is-scrolled` class after 100px of scroll
- **Smooth scrolling** — Anchor links scroll smoothly to their targets
- **Scroll animations** — IntersectionObserver triggers `.animate-on-scroll` elements
- **Countdown timer** — Displays days remaining until the event (November 5, 2026)
- **Active nav highlighting** — Updates navigation link state based on scroll position

## Event Details

The theme content is built around:

- **Event:** WordCamp Canada 2026
- **Dates:** November 5–6, 2026
- **Location:** UBC Robson Square, 800 Robson Street, Vancouver, BC
- **Pillars:** Connections, Community, Contributing

## Development

### Requirements

- WordPress 6.0 or later
- PHP 7.4 or later

### Setup

1. Clone or copy this theme into `wp-content/themes/`
2. Activate through Appearance > Themes
3. Open the Site Editor to customize templates and patterns

### Cache Busting

The theme uses `filemtime()` for automatic cache busting on CSS and JS assets — no build step required.

### Editor Support

Editor styles are enqueued so the block editor reflects the frontend design. Page titles are hidden from the editor UI for a cleaner content editing experience.
